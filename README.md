# Random facts
### I made them all up
## Shadows have no speed, yet they still move
### Shadows are the absence of light, thus do not posess any kind of velocity (I think)
## There is a person, who you've never met, but would give their life for you
### There are kind people, also they might just like you (or your feet)
## If you don't like yourself, you're just not your type
### Ye
## You cannot have the knowledge of not knowing something, unless you know that you don't know that thing, but if you do, you still don't have it
### If ya know that you don't know, then you know that you don't know, thus you cannot not know that you don't know
