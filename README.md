## What I like
### Learning, but only to a certain degree, like programming, maximum is like maybe ~6-7 hours a day, 5-6 days a week, on my own.
### Helping people
### SOMETIMES doing specific chores, like there are times when I just wake up and start tidying and/or cleaning my room or the house

## What I hate
### Washing dishes
### Usually studying with other people, there are very few people whom I can actually study with

# Random facts
### I made them all up
## Shadows have no speed, yet they still move
### Shadows are the absence of light, thus do not posess any kind of velocity (I think)
## There is a person, who you've never met, but would give their life for you
### There are kind people, also they might just like you (or your feet)
## If you don't like yourself, you're just not your type
### Ye
## You cannot have the knowledge of not knowing that you don't know something, unless you know that you don't know that thing, but if you do, you still don't
### If ya know that you don't know, then you cannot not know not knowing it
### Something, as in a given thing, like I know I don't know things that I don't know that I don't know, but that something is e.g. I don't know what Prowless means, if I think about not knowing it, I know that I don't know it, thus you can't know what things you don't know
## Yes, it's 3:44am
### I'm tired
